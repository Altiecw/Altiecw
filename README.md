## Welcome to my profile and projects!

My name is Creston Altiere. I am a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a masters in computer science. My work ranges from basic school projects such recreating old games like Hunt the Wumpus to scale models of theme parks and raytracings. The visual and creative side of programming is what I yearn to do, and I strive to implement style, whether it be computer graphics or clean code.

I have worked in software development for virtual reality and simulation programs. Both have interested me plenty. I do hope to broaden my work to other areas too.

## Repositories

The repositories on my Github included recent works alongside fixing and improving interesting projects from university. These will include some simulations, games, and rendering programs. Check back frequently for new projects or updates to older ones. These will mainly be C#, C++, or Python.

Currently, I have two projects: a C++ simulator of processor caches and my repository of OpenGL demos. More shall be uploaded soon.
